## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern agriculture faces numerous challenges that impact food security and sustainability:

- Unpredictable weather patterns affecting crop planning
- Declining soil fertility and resource depletion
- Inefficient resource utilization (water, labor, fertilizer)
- Limited access to agricultural expertise
- Inadequate monitoring systems for livestock and security
- Lack of data-driven decision-making tools

## 💡 Solution

Our AI-Driven Farming Support System integrates multiple intelligent components to provide comprehensive agricultural assistance:

### Key Features

#### 1. Interactive LLM Chatbot 🤖
- Access to vast agricultural knowledge base
- Real-time farming advice and best practices
- Interactive Q&A support for farmers

#### 2. Smart Recommendations 📊
- **Fertilizer Recommender**: Custom fertilizer suggestions based on soil composition and crop requirements
- **Crop Recommender**: AI-powered crop selection based on:
  - Soil conditions
  - Climate patterns
  - Market demand
  - Resource availability

#### 3. Predictive Analytics 📈
- **Crop Yield Predictor**: ML-based yield forecasting
- **Weather Forecasting**: Integration with weather APIs for accurate planning
- **Disease Detection**: Early identification of crop diseases using computer vision

#### 4. Monitoring Systems 📹
- **Livestock Monitoring**: AI-powered health and behavior tracking
- **Intruder Detection**: Advanced security system using computer vision
